==Wack-a-Mole====ELEVATOR PITCH==

Nothing better than turning a brutal reality of the prarie into a JS game! What is there to say? When the moles pop up, shmack em and get points! If you miss 3 of those pesty moles, you're donezo and so is your farm! Get to work !



=WIREFRAME=
Browser window>
-Title
-squared off area for the game to occur in
-start game button
-score counter 
Game>
-9 holes
-hidden moles that pop up for random inverals
-Lives counter
-status counter (i.e. where it tells you if you hit the mole or it got away , and when you lose)

=MVP GOALS=

-9 holes *Completed*
-moles pop out of holes at random interval *Completed*
-miss three moles and you lose *Completed*
-score++ when you hit a mole *Completed*
-custom assets *Completed*


=STRETCH GOALS=
-Custom board asset for background 
-animations *Completed*
-Persistent ScoreBoard
-stylized window and button *Completed*
-Orwellian Theme and assets *Completed*
-Fun Fact Section *Completed*
-Favicon *Completed*
-Lives heart Icons *Completed*


=POTENTIAL ROADBLOCKS=
-Random elements creating bugs
- difficulty balancing

== IF I HAD TO DO IT ALL OVER ==
- Use canvas to create Depth Elements
- Create several animations and characters for more diversity
- Use flexbox over grid if not using canvas.. Would be easier to fill sides of pages with content without messing with board
-Custom Title GIF for transition to Mole Farm
-Wack-a-Pig would be more on par for Animal Farm references
