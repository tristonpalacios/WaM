# POTENTIAL ROADBLOCKS=
* Random elements creating bugs
- difficulty balancing

# IF I HAD TO DO IT ALL OVER
- Use canvas to create Depth Elements
- Create several animations and characters for more diversity
- Use flexbox over grid if not using canvas.. Would be easier to fill sides of pages with content without messing with board
-Custom Title GIF for transition to Mole Farm
-Wack-a-Pig would be more on par for Animal Farm references
